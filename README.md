# ChessAI
This project is for me to play around & learn about how to create a chess AI using minimax and beta pruning. 
In the future, I might create a GUI for this project; but as of now, the goal is that the user will simply paste in the FEN of the current position and the best move will be calculated.

## Current Progress
 - Able to generate a board from FEN
 - DOING RN : Check if a given move is valid for the particular piece
