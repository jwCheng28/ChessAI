# Program Structure

ChessPiece
    - Have a var that indicates piece type.
    - Have a var that indicates piece color.

PieceMovement
    - Have a function that checks if a move is valid for the selected piece.
    - New Implementation uses a 2D array

    /* Old Implementation
    - Numbers used for validating are found by the possible position deltas shown as follow.
        Deltas for old implementation (1D-Array for entire board)
        Removed due to confusing/hacky math for validation
        |   |   |   |-17|   |-15|   |   |
        |   |   |-10| -9| -8| -7| -6|   |
        |   |   |   | -1| c | +1|   |   |
        |   |   | +6| +7| +8| +9|+10|   |
        |   |   |   |+15|   |+17|   |   |
    */

Board
    - Matrix of ChessPiece.
    - Build the initial matrix thru FEN.

Chess AI
    - Uses Minimax

# TO DO
 - Thorough testing to check if there's still edge cases for move validation
 - Minimax Algo very slow (Implement Alpha-Beta Pruning)
